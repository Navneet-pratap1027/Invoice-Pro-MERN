## ⚖️ Business Rules & Logic (Live)
The application is currently built on strict core business logic:
* **Line Total**: Calculated as `quantity × unit price` for each item.
* **Grand Total**: The sum of all line totals in the invoice.
* **Balance Due**: Calculated as `Total Amount – Amount Paid`.
* **Auto-Status**: When an invoice is fully paid, the status automatically updates to **PAID**.
